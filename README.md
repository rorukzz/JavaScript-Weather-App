### JavaScript-Weather-App

#### Overview
The "JavaScript-Weather-App" is a web application that allows users to check the weather forecast for a specific location. It provides real-time weather information and conditions for a selected location. Here's a breakdown of how to use the application, the libraries or APIs it relies on, and its core functionality.

#### Usage

1. **Installation and Setup**
   - Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/rorukzz/JavaScript-Weather-App).
   - Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.

2. **Obtaining API Key**
   - The application relies on a weather API to fetch weather data. To use the app, you'll need to sign up for an API key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeather, Weatherstack, or similar).

3. **Running the Application**
   - Open the repository's root directory.
   - Locate the HTML file, typically named `index.html`, and open it in your web browser.

4. **Input Location**
   - Use the provided input field to enter a location (e.g., a city or a geographical location).

5. **Fetch Weather Data**
   - Click on a "Get Weather" button to fetch and display weather data for the specified location.

#### Libraries and Technologies Utilized

The application primarily relies on client-side web technologies:

1. **HTML**: The structure of the application's web pages is defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

2. **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to define the visual styling and layout of the application.

3. **JavaScript**: The core functionality of the weather app is implemented in JavaScript.

4. **Weather API**: The application fetches weather data from a weather service provider's API using the API key you obtained during setup.

#### Functionality

The core functionality of the "JavaScript-Weather-App" includes:

1. **Location Input**: Users can enter a location (city or geographical coordinates) for which they want to check the weather.

2. **Weather Display**: The application fetches real-time weather data for the specified location and displays information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

3. **Weather Icons**: Icons representing the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) are displayed alongside the weather data.

4. **Error Handling**: The app typically includes error handling to manage situations where the entered location is invalid or the API request fails.

5. **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **API Integration**: The app demonstrates how to make API requests and handle API responses using JavaScript.

Please note that the "JavaScript-Weather-App" is a client-side web application and does not require a server or database. It relies on a weather API for real-time weather data.
